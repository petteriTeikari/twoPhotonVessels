# Spectral analysis of 2PM imaging

Run <code>analyzeSpectralCharacteristics_FV1000MPE</code> which imports the tabulated spectral characteristics. And then uses that to calculate Spectral Separability Index X<sub>ijk</sub>(well eventually), and do spectral unmixing to improve your signal quality. The X<sub>ijk</sub> can be used to help your fluorophore choice considering the restriction imposed by our 2PM-setup (light sources and channels).
